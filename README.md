DESCRIPTION

- With the emergence of Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, a smart factory has turned into a reality. The development of technology to collect and 
analyze data from sensors in real time provides the ability to monitor and proactively resolve issues that come up in the production process. It has become possible 
to extremely easily keep track of the performance levels of the equipment well before it breaks down or technical failure, causing a hindrance in the overall 
productivity of the factory. The Smart Factory Accelerator (SFA) is designed to initiate a result oriented approach that facilitates prevention of any possible 
collapse in the machinery that would cause a negative impact on production. The solution aims to put in place a monitoring system that analyzes key causes of failure 
so that factories can make Zero Downtime a reality.

- Using The Smart Factory Accelerator, the sensors, devices, people and process become a part of the connected ecosystem, where it is employed. All the relevant 
data is aggregated, analyzed and thus acted upon. As modern factories are populated with complex and expensive equipment, it becomes essential to get a clear picture 
of what is happening in the factory without any delay. Therefore, identifying bottlenecks in processing, taking proactive steps to deal with changing situations, and 
increasing awareness of the operational system are key to sensor-based monitoring. The salient features of Smart Factory Accelerator are its IoT integration with 
ThingsBoard and real-time alerting system with alert notification to employeeâ€™s Telegram Bot as well as on device manager of ThingsBoard, providing real time updates 
of any machine malfunction to the operator to initiate a corrective measure.
